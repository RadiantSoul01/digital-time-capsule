# 🌍 Digital Time Capsule – HTML Project

This is a simple yet meaningful project I built as part of my HTML learning journey.

##  About the Project

The ** Digital Time Capsule ** is a personal webpage where I’ve written a letter to my future self, shared my current skills and goals, and included some hidden thoughts using semantic HTML5 tags.

I created this to apply the HTML concepts I’ve learned so far, and to mark my first step into the world of web development.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Structuring a webpage using HTML
- Using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<details>`, and `<time>`
- Creating a clean, readable layout with only HTML


##  Technologies Used

- HTML5 only (no CSS or JavaScript yet)

## 🚀 What’s Next 

- Add styling with CSS
- Make it responsive for different screen sizes
- Maybe turn it into a full interactive time capsule in the future!
